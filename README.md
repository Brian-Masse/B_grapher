# COFFFEE

A modular, object-oriented data visualizer that enables easily customizable, component-based renders. Built off *Numpy and Pandas* it supports a wide range of data types and formats, and includes intelligent and customizable data aggregation functions. Using the *Pygame* library, as well as my custom python *Visual* class, all renders are guaranteed to be effective data communicators, while maintaining a beautifully striking appearance!

Enjoy :)

( ! New aggregate types, visual variables, and patches are continuing to be added :) ! ) 

Here are some of the beautiful designs produced by cofffee!
