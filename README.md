# COFFFEE

### **Installation**
``` pip install cofffee ``` !


### **Project Overview**

Coffee is a modular, object-oriented data visualizer that enables easily customizable, component-based renders. Its built on top of Numpy and Pandas to support a  range of data formats, industry standard aggregation functions, and great performance. In combination with the pygame library and a collection of individually-crafted,  visual packages, cofffe produces visualizations that are both easy to program and effectively communicate data, while maintaining a striking appearance.

Cofffee was developed to address a lack of easily-customizable, non-proprietary python data visualizers. While taking a data vis class, I noticed that nearly every industry tool either lacked developer customization—such as excel and figma— or had proprietary data formats and style guides. Cofffee solves this as an open source data visualizer, both because it relies on industry standard systems and because it exposes all developer functions in the API for fully customizable renders. The color system + render styles are my own open-source python packages based in sRGB space, but can be translated into HSV and HSL.
